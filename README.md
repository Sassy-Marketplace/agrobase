# AgroBase üå±

AgroBase is a blockchain-based platform designed to tackle the challenges of hunger, poverty, and unemployment in Nigeria by revitalizing agriculture and empowering youth to invest in the sector. Our mission is to create a sustainable agricultural ecosystem, revolutionizing how agriculture is managed, financed, and connected to markets through the use of decentralized technologies.

## üåç **Why We Are Participating for Based Africa**

Growing up in Emene Umuchigbo, Enugu State, we witnessed the struggles of poverty, unemployment, and a lack of sustainable opportunities firsthand. Despite promises of economic improvements, challenges like food scarcity, high prices, and limited job opportunities have only grown. We realized that the solution lies in our agricultural roots, and AgroBase is our response to awaken Nigeria's rich agricultural potential.

Agriculture was the backbone of Nigeria's economy, contributing over 60% of the GDP in the 1960s. However, by 2019, this number fell to around 22%. With AgroBase, we aim to restore agriculture to its former glory by using blockchain technology to connect farmers and agribusinesses to wider markets.

## üöÄ **Our Mission**

AgroBase aims to digitize Africa's agricultural ecosystem and bring it on-chain. We are focused on creating an MVP that connects all players in the agricultural supply chain (farmers, buyers, mini-agrobusinesses, and AgroLogistics) for business purposes. Our goal is to provide small-scale farmers and agrobusinesses with better access to markets, transparent pricing, and streamlined supply chains.

## üõ† **Key Features**

1. **Tokenization of Agricultural Assets**: Tradable markets for Real World Assets (RWA) such as Crop Coins, Plant Coins, Animal Coins, and Rare Animal Species NFTs.
2. **Smart Contracts for Transparent Deals**: Enforceable agreements between stakeholders without intermediaries.
3. **Decentralized Financing (DeFi)**: Farmers can access undercollateralized loans and insurance without traditional banks.
4. **Traceability and Supply Chain Optimization**: Transparent, tamper-proof records of products from farm to market.
5. **Agro Minerals and Earth Land Markets**: Marketplace for trading minerals and land-based assets.
6. **Agro Jobs**: Easy access to job opportunities in the agricultural sector.
7. **Cross-border Payments and Financing**: Simplified and secure payment methods.
8. **Decentralized Insurance**: Protecting farmers, agribusinesses, and entrepreneurs from financial risks.

## üéØ **Challenges We Are Addressing**

- **Inefficient Supply Chains**: Streamlining the journey from farm to market.
- **Limited Access to Finance**: Creating opportunities for farmers to secure credit.
- **Market Access Barriers**: Connecting producers to local and global markets.
- **Food Insecurity**: Ensuring nutritious food reaches all communities.
- **Youth Engagement**: Inspiring the next generation of agricultural innovators.
- **Climate Resilience**: Adapting to and mitigating the impacts of climate change.
- **Rural Poverty**: Breaking the cycle through agricultural development.

## üõ§ **How Our Solution Addresses These Challenges**

Our approach utilizes blockchain technology and decentralized solutions to address root causes like food scarcity, high prices, unemployment, and climate change. AgroBase provides tools that enhance market connectivity, reduce food waste, and create sustainable livelihoods for all participants in the agricultural value chain.

## üõ† **Tech Stack**

- **Blockchain**: For decentralized smart contracts and transparent transactions.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: For undercollateralized loans and agricultural asset trading.
- **NFTs and Tokenization**: Creating a market for tradable assets in agriculture.
- **Smart Contracts**: Enforcing secure agreements between stakeholders.

## üßó **Challenges We Faced**

During development, we encountered several technical hurdles due to the complexity of integrating various blockchain features and interpreting the designs from the design team. We overcame these challenges by rewriting and optimizing the smart contracts, ensuring they are robust and scalable for future growth.

## üí° **Future Roadmap**

- **Expand AgroBase MVP**: Further develop the platform to include advanced features and integrate additional markets.
- **AgroWorld Onchain Expansion**: Fully digitize and tokenize Africa‚Äôs agricultural ecosystem.
- **Community Engagement**: Collaborate with local farmers, youth, and businesses to grow the AgroBase movement.
